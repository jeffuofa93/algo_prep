Focused on tree problems. 
Leetcode 1104 - Path in zig zag tree - Failed 
  Their was a math trick I didn't get when exploring this problem seemed difficult to do without it 
  The value of the parent of the current position = max val on level + min_val on level - label  // 2 
Leetcode 314 Vertical Order Traversal - light pass/fail 
  Had the intutition for the problem right away but my mistake is I traversed the tree with DFS instead of BFS 
  which caused misordering for items in same vertical column 
Leetcode 1650 Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree - strong pass 
Leetcode 266 Find leaves of a binary tree - fail 
  Reached identical approach to optimal solution but was doing it in two separate functions where I calculated 
  the height of each node instead of doing the height and adding the leaves in one pass

Got started working on a project to learn typescript with React I'm familiar with JS but haven't 
used typescript. I have an idea for a personal project I want to take a stab at where it's a website 
that has all the gambling lines for major sports events and allows user to "bet" against their friends
it wouldn't use actual money it would just be points or coins in the site but I wonder if that would look 
bad on a resume because of the gambling piece? Idk
