Yesterday:
I met with Dan to get my study plan together and work through the topics to solidify my understanding. My
first topic I'm focusing on is trees I completed leetcode problem 103 zig zag level order traversal which I completed
naively by reversing the level for every odd list where the optimal solution adds to alternating sides of the queue 

For my github I started to work on adding a logger to one of my existing personal projects 

Today:
Continue working through tree problems.
